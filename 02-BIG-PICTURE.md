## 🎯 North Star

**Remember:**
Every word, every section, every design choice should answer:

> "Does this help a scared, talented actor take the next step toward becoming who they've always known they could be?"

If yes → keep it.  
If no → cut it.

---

## 💡 What We Know Works

**Messaging:**
- Personal vulnerability (Hans's 5-year delay)
- "You're right on time" (more powerful than "not behind")
- Credibility before asking for email (trust-building)
- Soft-sell approach (optional, not forced)

**Design:**
- Cinematic black backgrounds
- Warm, accessible photos (not headshots)
- Knights as subtle guides/encouragers
- Rounded squares > circles for photos
- Compact modals that match quiz card size

**UX:**
- Progress bars that stay visible
- Loading screen only after commitment (not after email)
- Knight pointing at CTA (subtle nudge)
- "No thanks" option that feels guilt-free
