**Q2: What if I miss a live session?**
A: Life happens! Every session is recorded and available within 24 hours. You'll have access to all recordings and materials during your 12-week program.

A: Plan for 4-6 hours weekly: 90-minute live call, 2-3 hours for self-tape challenges, and 1-2 hours for reflection and exercises. This is a transformation journey, not a passive course.

A: Absolutely. The journey works for beginners through working actors. You'll discover your unique superpower regardless of experience level. The only requirement is willingness to do the work.

**Q5: Will this work if I'm already booking some roles?**

**Q9: Is this just another acting class?**
A: No. Most classes teach technique. This is about discovering WHO you are as an actor and building your career around that truth. You'll leave with clarity, materials, and a roadmap‚Äînot just more exercises.

**Q10: Will I work directly with Hans?**

A: We want this accessible to committed actors. You can pay $1,297 upfront or 4 monthly payments of $325 ($1,300 total). Both options get you full access immediately.

**Q13: What's your guarantee?**
A: 30-day money-back guarantee. If you feel this isn't right for you within 30 days, we'll refund your investment. No questions asked.
